                Based in Chicago, Illinois, Little Lemon is a family-owned
                Mediterranean restaurant, focused on traditional recipes served
                with a modern twist. The chefs draw inspiration from Italian,
                Greek, and Turkish culture and have a menu of 12â€“15 items that
                they rotate seasonally. The restaurant has a rustic and relaxed
                atmosphere with moderate prices, making it a popular place for a
                meal any time of the day.
              </p>

                Little Lemon is owned by two Italian brothers, Mario and Adrian,
                who moved to the United States to pursue their shared dream of
                owning a restaurant. To craft the menu, Mario relies on family
                recipes and his experience as a chef in Italy. Adrian does all
                the marketing for the restaurant and led the effort to expand
                the menu beyond classic Italian to incorporate additional
                cuisines from the Mediterranean region.
